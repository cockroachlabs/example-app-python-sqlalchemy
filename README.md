This repo contains the source code for a simple CRUD application, written in Python. The app uses the [SQLAlchemy ORM framework](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/) to connect to and communicate with an existing CockroachDB cluster.

For instructions on starting CockroachDB and running the code, see [this tutorial](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/stable/build-a-python-app-with-cockroachdb-sqlalchemy.html).
